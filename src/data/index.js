            San Antonio and the surrounding areas experience high

            At Family Pest Control, we understand the havoc these
            insects can cause. Whether they’re subterranean termites or
            Formosan termites, they’re problematic and need to go.
            That’s why we perform highly effective termite control
            services that address foraging termites as well as entire
            termite colonies.

            Like ants, termites have different forms that live in what
            is referred to a caste system. One of the more destructive
            termite castes is made up of workers that perform nest
            maintenance and forage for food.
          </p>
          <p>
            The workers are frequently found infesting - and ingesting -
            wood in homes, businesses, and other structures. While they
            primarily like to feed on wood, workers will also eat plants
            at any level of decomposition.

            San Antonio and the surrounding areas experience high
            termite activity. It’s not a matter of if your home will
            become infested by these wood destroying insects but when.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Family Pest Control, we understand the havoc these
            insects can cause. Whether they’re subterranean termites or
            Formosan termites, they’re problematic and need to go.
            That’s why we perform highly effective termite control
            services that address foraging termites as well as entire
            termite colonies.

            Like ants, termites have different forms that live in what
            is referred to a caste system. One of the more destructive
            termite castes is made up of workers that perform nest
            maintenance and forage for food.
          </p>
          <p>
            The workers are frequently found infesting - and ingesting -
            wood in homes, businesses, and other structures. While they
            primarily like to feed on wood, workers will also eat plants
            at any level of decomposition.
